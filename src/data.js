Satya and the leadership team are phenomenal. My decision to retire is an uncomplicated one: I've achieved everything I set out to do and have enough to enjoy a simple life now. To me, understanding what is enough is important for avoiding the never-enough trap. My father told me something years ago that shaped this understanding: a group of people with access to a mountain of food will take what they need until they are full - but a group of people with access to a mountain of money will never stop taking. In the final analysis, with time as a fixed resource, I'm choosing a simple life and feel profound gratitude that my time at Microsoft has afforded me this opportunity.",

        "fullDesc": "Hooks are reusable functions. They allow you to use state and other features (e.g. lifecycle methods and so on) without writing a class. Hook functions let us “hook into” the React state lifecycle using functional components, allowing us to manipulate the state of our functional components without needing to convert them to class components. React introduced hooks back in version 16.8 and has been adding more ever since. Some are more used and popular than others, like useEffect, useState, and useContext hooks. I have no doubt that you’ve reached for those if you work with React.",

But as we aim to write more and better code, the way we write and communicate in everyday language becomes more and more important… and perhaps even overlooked. The way we write about and around code is arguably as important as the code itself. And despite where you fall on that line, we can all agree that our words have the potential to both help and hurt code’s effectiveness. In this article, I want to outline how these two seemingly distinct fields — programming and writing — can come together and take our developer skills to the next level.",
